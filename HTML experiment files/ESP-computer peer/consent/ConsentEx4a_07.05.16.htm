<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:115%'><span style='line-height:115%'>Together
with scientists at the University of Canterbury in New Zealand, I am conducting
a research study to understand </span>how people understand words, learn words,
and create new words. The project is sponsored by the John Templeton
Foundation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-31.5pt'>If you agree to participate, you
will first answer a short series of questions about your age, gender, and
language background. Then you will see instructions for playing the word game,
and the game will start. The word game has two players, who are put into
contact with each other through the game interface. The other player may be a
person or a computer program. You will not know who the other player is, but if
it is a human, we will tell you before the game starts. While playing the game,
<span style='color:black'>you will see pictures or text on the screen and you will
be asked to judge, select, or enter words that go with them. You will respond
using </span>the keyboard, mouse or trackpad<span style='color:black'> of your
computer, and you will also find out how the other player responds.</span>  The
game will last from 10 to 30 minutes. At the end of the game, you may be asked
to provide feedback to the research team by responding to 5 to 10 short
questions about your experience in the game.           </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The responses will be analyzed by the research team. They
will also be saved in a database that will be shared with other scientists in
the future. The database will NOT include any information that could be used to
identify you.</p>

people play for fun.</p>
